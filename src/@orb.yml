  This Orb is designed to help with interacting with Cachix binary caches.

  For those that use the nix package system, Cachix is the go-to for remote
  binary caches. This orb allows you to configure the Cachix binary to use your
  remote binary cache (or any other valid binary cache) as well as tools to upload
  new artifacts after a nix build.
# What will your orb allow users to accomplish?
# Descriptions should be short, simple, and informative.

# This information will be displayed in the orb registry and is not mandatory.
